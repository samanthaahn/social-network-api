## Installation
In order to use this api, you'll ned to install MongoDB and express. 

## Usage
In order to start the application, you'll need to type "npm i" to install all the dependencies (type this in your terminal). Then you'll type in your terminal "node index.js" to start up the api. Since there is no front end, you'll have to use Insomia or Postman to view the different types of requests.
